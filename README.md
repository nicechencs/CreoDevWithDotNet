# CreoDevWithDotNet

This repository focuses on secondary development of Creo using .NET. It leverages C# to interact with Creo's C API functions, enabling seamless integration and improving development efficiency. By utilizing .NET, we can enhance Creo's functionality while benefiting from a modern development environment, reducing the complexity of working directly with C/C++.

## Features

- **.NET Integration**: Use C# to call Creo Toolkit C API functions.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Simplifies development and boosts productivity.
- **Struct Conversion**: Automatically converts C structs to C# structs for easier handling.

## AI-Assisted Code Conversion

In the future, users will be able to leverage AI tools to assist in converting code from C/C++ to C#. AI will help automate the process of translating C/C++ code to C#, reducing manual effort and accelerating development, making it easier to integrate Creo with .NET.
